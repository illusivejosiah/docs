There are two types of authentication methods to secure your proxy:

Basic (Username & Password)
Whitelist (IP Address)
Only one authentication method is active at a time.

- -
Basic authentication allows you to add security to your proxy in the form of a username and password. Only someone who has access to your username and password will be able to connect to the proxy.

### Update Username & Password

Head to your Illusory dashboard to update your proxy's Basic Authentication

Whitelist authentication allows you to add security to your proxy in the form of an IP address. Only machine IPs that have been authorized will be able to connect to the proxy.

Once you determine the IP of your machine(s), you may add it to the authorized list. You may add multiple proxies to the list by using commas to separate each individual proxy.

All proxies can be purchased for a set amount of time. The expiration length is decided by you and is based on the period and interval you select upon deploying proxies. You may extend the proxies at hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly periods. Each period can be multiplied by preset intervals.

To keep a proxy active, you must extend the expiration time. This ensures the proxy does not deactivate. If a proxy expires before it is extended, the proxy will be removed from your account. There are multiple ways to extend a proxy's expiration.

Methods to extend proxies
ðŸ“„ Automatic Renewal (Recommended)
ðŸ“„ Manual Extension

---

Automatic Renewal is the recommended extension method for proxies. It ensures you don't lose your proxies, provided you have enough funds in your wallet.
