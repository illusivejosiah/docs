### Expiration methods

All proxies can be purchased for a set amount of time. The expiration length is decided by you and is based on the period and interval you select upon deploying proxies. You may extend the proxies at hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly periods. Each period can be multiplied by preset intervals.

<Warning>
    To keep a proxy active, you must extend the expiration time. This ensures the proxy does not deactivate. If a proxy expires before it is extended, the proxy will be removed from your account.
</Warning>
