title: 'Update Proxies Renewal'
openapi: 'PATCH /v1/proxies/allocate/renew'

You can specify whether you want specific proxies to automatically allocate time when they expire. If enabled, the proxy will automatically renew for the same amount of time as the current period.

<Warning>
    If disabled, the proxy will expire and be removed from your account unless you manually allocate time it.
