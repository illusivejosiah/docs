IPv4 addresses can be toggled on and off for a proxy. When toggled off, the proxy will only be assigned an IPv6 and no IPv4 will be assigned.

<Warning>
    Some sites may not work with IPv6 only. Please test your site with IPv6 before disabling IPv4. You can test your
    site with IPv6 by using the following URL: [Domsignal](https://domsignal.com/ipv6-test/)
