IPv4 addresses can be toggled on and off for a proxy. When toggled off, the proxy will only be assigned an IPv6 and no IPv4 will be assigned.

<Warning>
    Some sites may be unreachable with IPv6 only enabled. Please test your site with IPv6 before disabling IPv4. To test the target site
    for IPv6 readiness, you can use a service like <a href="https://domsignal.com/ipv6-test" target="_blank">Domsignal</a>
