### Base URL

The Illusory API is built on REST principles. We enforce HTTPS in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support HTTP.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://cmd.illusory.io
```

### Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being `Bearer zpka_12345` where `zpka_12345` is your [API Key](https://app.illusory.io/settings/developers).

```
Authorization: Bearer zpka_12345
```


### Rate Limiting

Different endpoints have different rate limits. If you exceed the rate limit you will receive a `429` response code.
