### Method 1: Configure iPhone apps (Recommended)

Most popular apps:

- [Shadowrocket](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shadowrocket/id932747118) (iPhone, iPad, Apple TV)
- [Surge](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/surge-4/id1442620678) (iPhone, iPad, Apple TV)
- [Stash](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/stash-rule-based-proxy/id1596063349?platform=iphone) (iPhone, iPad, Apple TV)

Once you download those, you can follow their guides on adding a proxy.

### Method 2: Configure iPhone Wi-Fi settings

<Steps>
    <Step title="Wi-Fi Settings">
        Go to Settings and select Wi-Fi.

        Tap the `i` icon next to the Wi-Fi network you want to enable the proxy server for.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Proxy Details">
        Scroll to HTTP Proxy and tap `Configure Proxy`.

        Select `Manual`.

        Tap `Server` and enter the proxy server address.

        <Note>
            If you’ve authenticated by whitelisting your IP address, you don’t need to enter the credentials. We
            recommend using whitelist IP for Android and iOS connections for ease of use.
